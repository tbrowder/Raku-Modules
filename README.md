NAME
====

**RakudoPkg** - Provides tools for easing use of the 'rakudo-pkg' system for Debian and Ubuntu

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use RakudoPkg;
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

**RakudoPkg** is a Raku module with one script for the root user to bootstrap the 'rakudo-pkg' installation by use of a rudumentary 'rakudo' package installation. After successful bootstrapping, the system's 'rakudo' package will be deleted.

Note this package is designed for the purpose of standardizing multi-user Linux hosts for classrooms or computer laboratories.

Procedures
----------

Normally you will be using this module on a system which has not had Raku installed other than with its normal package installation, but it can uninstall completely any previous such installations.

### Install the Debian or Ubuntu `rakudo` package

    $ sudo apt-get install rakudo

We use the distro's version to 'bootstrap' our desired Rakudo framework.

### Install the `rakudo-pkg` framework

    $ sudo rp-root install raku

The command does the following:

  * deletes any existing /opt/rakudo-pkg directory

  * installs the rakudo-pkg framework

  * installs the new rakudo package

  * removes the system rakudo package

### Install the `zef` module installer

    $ sudo rp-root install zef

The command does the following:

  * deletes any existing .raku, .zef, or zef directories for root.

  * installs and updates zef for root

### Install a curated set of modules for public use

A list of modules the author uses is in `%?RESOURCES`, but another list may be provided if desired. The input list must be a text file with one module name per line (along with any adverbs desired).

### Install zef for a user

    $ rp-user install zef

The command does the following:

  * deletes any existing .raku, .zef, or zef directories for the user.

  * installs and updates zef for the user.
