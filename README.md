NAME
====

**RakudoPkg** - Provides tools for easing installation and use of the 'rakudo-pkg' system for Debian and Ubuntu

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use RakudoPkg;
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

**RakudoPkg** is a Raku module with programs for the root user to bootstrap the 'rakudo-pkg' installation by use of a system 'rakudo' package installation. After successful bootstrapping, the system's 'rakudo' package should be deleted to avoid conflicts.

Note this package is designed for the purpose of standardizing multi-user Linux hosts for classrooms or computer laboratories.

Procedures for installation
---------------------------

Normally you will be using this module on a system which has not had Raku installed other than with its normal package installation, but it will uninstall completely any previous `rakudo-pkg` installation in an existing `/opt/rakudo-pkg` directory.

There are three steps to follow.

### Step 1 - Install the Debian or Ubuntu `rakudo` package

    $ sudo apt-get install rakudo

We use the distro's version to 'bootstrap' our desired Rakudo framework.

### Step 2 - Install the `rakudo-pkg` framework

    $ sudo install-rakudo-pkg

The command does the following:

  * deletes any existing /opt/rakudo-pkg directory

  * installs the rakudo-pkg framework

  * installs the new rakudo package

### Step 3 - Remove the system's 'rakudo' package

    $ sudo apt-get remove rakudo

Procedures for **complete** removal
-----------------------------------

Should you ever want to remove the `rakudo-pkg` installation, run the following program as root: `remove-rakudo-pkg`.

The pertinent parts of that bash script are shown here:

    echo "Starting removal of 'rakudo-pkg'..."

    apt-get remove rakudo-pkg
    rm -rf /opt/rakudo-pkg
    rm -rf /etc/profile.d/rakudo-pkg.sh
    apt-get update

    # clean repository info
    rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nxadm-pkgs-rakudo-pkg.list
    apt-get clean
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
    apt-get update

    echo "Removal of rakudo-pkg is complete."
    exit

Note the removal does not delete anything in any users' home directory, so there may be `raku`- or `zef`-related artifacts remaining in those places.
